       Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

      <p>
       AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri or Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla), and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go), As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.

       For most of its history, no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research. AI research divided into competing sub-fields that often failed to communicate with each other. Some of these sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks) or social factors (e.g. particular institutions or researchers) but they also came from deep philosophical differences that led to very different approaches to AI.

        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
        class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
        loosely typed methods.

      The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches, so much so that some sources (especially in the business world) use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks". However, the questions that have divided AI research historically have remained unanswered and may have to be revisited by future research.

      A few of the most long-standing questions that have remained unanswered.

      To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
      first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      <code
        >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
      </code>

      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your

      AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.


    </p>
    <p>
High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google Search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays, prediction of judicial decisions, targeting online advertisements, and energy storage.    </p>
    <p>
With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution, major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.

AI can also produce Deepfakes, a content-altering technology. ZDNet reports, "It presents something that did not actually occur," Though 88% of Americans believe Deepfakes can cause more harm than good, only 47% of them believe they can be targeted. The boom of election year also opens public discourse to threats of videos of falsified politician media.

     There are three philosophical questions related to AI:
      <p>
        Whether artificial general intelligence is possible; whether a machine can solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence, or if there are hard limits to what a machine can accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether intelligent machines are dangerous; how humans can ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do; if a machine can be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights âˆ’ and if a machine can intentionally cause harm.

       A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.
      </p>

      <p>
       If research into Strong AI produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement. The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario "singularity". Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.
      </p>
      <p>
Ray Kurzweil has used Moore's law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.
      </p>
      <p>
      Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.

Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.
      </p>
      <p>
       Widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable. Scientists from the Future of Life Institute, among others, described some short-term research goals to see how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks. In the long-term, the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies.
      </p>
<p>
      Some are concerned about algorithmic bias, that AI programs may unintentionally become biased after processing data that exhibits bias. Algorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems. An example of this is COMPAS, a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. ProPublica claims that the average COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than the average COMPAS-assigned risk level of white defendants.

      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.

      <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an

      additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

      <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
